            <h1>Mentoring and counselling</h1>

            <h2>Informal mentoring and peer support</h2>

            <p>There is a wide range of excellent support for HQAs as well as their partners, extended family and friends.</p>

            <p>Club HQ members provide informal mentoring and peer support to any hindquarter amputee. When something as dramatic as amputation takes place in your life, the shared experience can be very helpful and many useful hours are spent discussing how one problem or another is overcome. Everybody has their individual way of cooking, carrying a cup of tea, going upstairs and downstairs with crutches or tailoring their jeans or swimsuit. Interaction amongst the group is greatly valued and experiences are often shared on the Facebook Group.</p>

            <p>To request peer support please use the <a href="contact-us">contact us</a> form.</p>

            <h2>Professional counselling and support</h2>

            <p>When it comes to the need for professional support Sarcoma UK provide a confidential support line run by health care professionals who have a number of years of experience in dealing with a Sarcoma diagnosis, advising on where to get a second opinion, explaining what your diagnosis means, helping you with anxiety, depression, sexual matters, palliative care, bereavement, getting back to work and general life advice.</p>

            <p>All members of Club HQ and their partners, children, family and friends can use this very special resource however small or large your concern may be. It may just be that you want to talk to somebody who is unconnected to your immediate family, or one of your friends is concerned about your situation and would like to talk it over with a sympathetic and knowledgeable ear.</p>

            <p>Sarcoma UK have helped over 3000 people since the support line was set up in 2016 and have a wonderful breadth of experience in working with people like us. They have run zoom meetings for Club HQ, discussing what we feel we need and what the carer half of the family feel they need.</p>

            <p>The team can be contacted Monday to Friday, 10am until 3pm on Freephone 0808 801 0401 or emails and texts can be sent at any time to supportline@sarcoma.org.uk or call 07860 058830.</p>

            <p>If the line is busy when you call, do leave a message and the team will get back to you.</p>
