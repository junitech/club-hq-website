            <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

            <h2>How do I get into a bath?</h2>
            <p>You should be able to use a normal bath, preferably one with handles, bu using a shower seat. First of all, place the shower seat close to and parallel with the bath, making sure the seat is at least as high as the top of the bath. Sit on the seat with your leg between the seat and the side of the bath. Swing your leg into the bath and place it on the bottom of the bath. Then take hold of each handle and swing yourself into the bath with a quarter turn left or right as preferred. If you have a left leg you will probably find it easier to have the taps on your right and swing to face them, or with a right leg have the taps to the right. When in the bath be careful not to slip towards your amputated side, and here the handles will come in useful. To get out of the bath, just do this in reverse. It is easier to do than to explain.</p>

            <h2>How do I use a shower?</h2>
            <p>Showers by their very nature are an area of danger for amputees. It is important to mitigate the risk of slipping and falling so the technique must be risk-free.
            Approach the shower either in a wheelchair or on crutches and transfer to a zimmer frame outside the shower with your towel on the frame.
            You must have a chair (not a stool) in the shower into which you transfer from the zimmer frame. The chair should not be able to slide around the shower. Take your shower whilst sitting in the chair, dry yourself after showering and whilst still in the chair, and then tranfer back to the zimmer frame and leave the shower.
            This methodology will work perfectly provided you are careful and do not try to overreach yourself.</p>

            <h2>Can I use an escalator?</h2>
            <p>You can use an escalator if you use crutches, but only attempt this for the first time when you feel confident. Start with a short up escalator. Preferably have someone with you to make sure you are safe. Stand at the base of the escalator for a few seconds to judge the speed. If you have a left leg, you should let go of the right hand crutch, so it is supported by the elbow cuff, then hold the rail as you swing onto the escalator with the left hand crutch. At the top of the escalator, do this in reverse. If you have a right leg, just do this the other way round.</p>

            <p>Using a down escalator is more complicated and is best not attempted until you have mastered the up escalator. The method is essentially the same as going up, but where it varies is that your unused crutch will probably bang against the escalator. With practice, or if a companion is there to hold your spare crutch, it is less daunting, but if in doubt do not try it - use the lift.</p>

            <h2>How do I get into a boat?</h2>
            <p>This varies from one type of vessel to another. A ship or large passenger or car ferry may have either level or ramp access, in which case it should be straightforward for crutch users. A small foot ferry, lifeboat or dinghy may be much more difficult owing to rocking, changes of level, or lack of hand rails. In all cases, however, there should be staff members around to help. Each situation will be different. Again, if you don’t feel confident, don’t do it. If possible, find out in advance how difficult it will be for you.</p>

            <p>If wheelchair users are allowed on board, there will be special arrangements for them.</p>

            <h2>How do I get onto a train or an aeroplane?</h2>
            <p>Special assistance, which should be requested in advance if possible, should always be available. See the FAQ section on transport.</p>
