            <h2>Murad Abdulkarim, Dublin, Eire</h2>
            <p>I was diagnosed with Leiomyosarcoma on my thigh of my right leg, in March 2009. I had my first surgery in April 2009 followed by Radiotherapy. But after about a year and a half the cancer came back on the same place so I had my second surgery with a deeper and wider incision. Unfortunately, in October 2015 the Sarcoma attacked me once again. This time it was aggressive and had spread throughout the right leg to the bone. I had my full right leg amputated at the hip joint. By February 2016 I got my prosthetic leg fitted and I continue though I suffer from phantom pains.</p>

            <h2>Ray Aspinwall, Forby, Merseyside</h2>
            <p>It's 13 years since I had an operation at Birmingham Orthopaedic Hospital to remove my hip and leg due to a diagnosis of Chondrosarcoma. After many years of long distance walking, playing golf and attending a gym I was worried that exercise would be severely restricted. I do have a prosthetic leg but I only use it for weddings and even then prefer to ditch it for dancing. I walk with crutches. I regularly walk 6-8 miles including in the Lake District and with a walking group.  I also keep fit by swimming up to half a mile twice a week.</p>

            <p>I am a retired Estate Agent in our local village. I am married to Dave and have two children and two grandchildren. I had a Sarcoma back in 1961 as a child, then had my amputation in 1965 when I was sixteen. I have travelled far a wide over the years and I still like my holidays. I love driving, going to the theatre and cinema and chatting with friends and family. I try to enjoy life to the full and am grateful for the love and support from myhusband and kids over the last 50 years.</p>

            <h2>Ian Coldicott, Lichfield, Staffordshire, Age 72</h2>
            <p>I slipped on some ice in Trondheim, Norway in 2014 and fractured my right femur. The x-ray revealed a chondrosarcoma. I was operated on and my leg repaired with metal. Subsequently I learnt the tumour was malignant. Several months after discharge I had a hindquarter amputation at RNOH Stanmore, and then took early retirement from local government. I am actively mobile using crutches, enjoy walking and still do most of the things I have always done, especially photography. I continued to play golf but I stopped as I found it just too hard, so now I like to walk round and watch the professionals play! I set up and run the Club HQ Secret Group on Facebook</p>

            <p>I was diagnosed with a leiomyosarcoma in 2000, since then I have had several operations and finally had a hindquarter amputation in July 2014.</p>
            <p>Since my operation I have a prosthetic leg and I have continued to drive, go on holiday both in the UK and abroad, and generally continue with my life as close to normal as possible.</p>
            <p>I have a hoist fitted to my car for my scooter which enables me to visit my family and go for long walks.</p>

            <h2>Simon Henson, Witney, Oxfordshire</h2>
            <p>In 2011 I went into hospital to have my left hip resurfaced and the operation was aborted when they looked at the X-Ray (after starting the operation!) and discovered a high grade Chondrosarcoma on the left side of my pelvis. Two weeks later I had my left leg amputated and the hip, pelvis and ischium removed. I returned to work and have done a lot of travelling, cycling, one-legged skiing and spend a lot of time in the gym. I found my prosthetic too slow and use Sidestix crutches and Flexifoot ferrules. My family and friends have been amazingly supportive and I pretty much lead my life as before except I've become a beekeeper.</p>

            <p>I live in a small village outside Tralee, County Kerry on the South West coast of Ireland.</p>
            <p>I had a hindquarter amputation of my right leg on the 22nd of April 2013. When the sarcoma was diagnosed my doctor suggested I should go to Stanmore for my operation as there is no Sarcoma unit in Ireland . This didn't bother me as I had lived in London in the past. After the operation and a lot of physio I returned home to County Kerry and more or less picked up where I left off. With a little help from friends and family I look after a small sheep farm and a pony trekking business that we also run in the summer. With a few adaptions, I can operate all the farm machinery and to the amazement of my friends and family and myself, I live a very normal life!</p>

            <h2>Sally Hughes, Kenilworth 55 (single but happy that way!)</h2>
            <p>I lost my left leg 11 years ago due to a rare soft tissue sarcoma. I was very poorly, had 18 bouts of chemo, and the scar took a number of years to heal.</p>
            <p>But 9 years ago I started to get better. I then looked after my Mum who had a stroke, but she died last January at 94 years old.</p>
            <p>I enjoy gardening, and cooking, I have a toy poodle called Robbie who follows me everywhere and sits where my left leg was. I believe he has helped me to get better.  I enjoy wheelchair tennis and swimming and have found that exercise helps me.  I enjoy taking Robbie for a walk, driving my scooter around Kenilworth, going to different parks and shopping in town.</p>
            <p>I regularly volunteer at Myton Hospice and you see people there who are worse off than me.</p>
            <p>Staying positive and believing I was going to beat cancer really helped me with the support of good friends.  There is alway a way around a problem.  At the beginning I was nervous of steps as I had a few falls, but you become more confident as time goes by.</p>

            <h2>Janine Jackson, Bracknell, Berkshire</h2>
            <p>I was diagnosed with a pleomorphic sarcoma in the pelvis in 2004 after 2 years of investigation. After 6 months of chemotherapy, I had a left side hind quarter amputation at RNOH Stanmore. I am married with three children who were remarkably resilient and adapted to having a disabled mother. I continued teaching English at the local Secondary school and took early retirement in 2018. I now tutor at home and volunteer for a charity, running their Life Skills course. I enjoy swimming, pilates and kayaking and this year, have taken up open water swimming, which I love. I have also tried out coxing which was great fun. My motto has been to make the most of what I can do, try not to dwell on what I can't, and practise gratitude.</p>

            <p>I was diagnosed with stage III Osteosarcoma in 2012 at the age of 26 and had a hemipelvectomy amputation as a result. At the time, I was serving in the military, U.S. Air Force, and was treated at Brooke Army Medical Center. I was fitted with a prosthesis, and was successful at walking unassisted in it, but prefer to ambulate with forearm crutches (SideStix) as they allow me to be more active. I have had two pregnancies post cancer and amputation and now have two healthy little boys to keep up with. I enjoy handcycling and swimming and have competed in both.  I also alpine ski (3 track).  My family and I currently live in Florida.</p>

            <p>I spent the early part of retirement narrow boating and looking after my allotment. In recent years I?ve discovered the joys of hand cycling and ride when I can. I am also a parish councillor and as such am involved in many village activities.</p>

            <p>I was diagnosed in 2009 by a biopsy and had Limb Salvage Surgery in 2010. However, by the end of 2012 the tumour returned more aggressively and I had to have an HQA in January 2013. Both surgeries were in Birmingham. In January 2014 I managed to resume my career as a Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist with the full time use of a prosthetic leg until I retired in May 2020.</p>

            <h2>Amanda Patchett, Derby, Derbyshire</h2>
            <p>I was diagnosed with metastasised thyroid cancer in my pelvis in 2010. In 2018 I took the decision to have a hind quarter amputation of my right leg at ROH Birmingham. I had a few infections and was in hospital for 7 weeks. I had the support of my friends and family throughout my time in hospital and people coming to see me kept me going.</p>
            <p>I live at home with my husband and daughter and I am a full time wheelchair user, but I still have a fulfilling life. I love going out with friends and have just got an adapted car. I have been on numerous holidays since my amputation. It takes a bit more planning but being by the sea is my spiritual home. I exercise by swimming and going to keep fit sessions run by Derby County.</p>
            <p>My passion in life is the Girl Guides and I am a Rainbow leader and a Division Commissioner. I think it is important that young people see that having a disability doesn't have to stop you from doing whatever you want!</p>

            <h2>Marian Ramsay, Stanmore, Middlesex</h2>
            <p>I was just 19 when I discovered a swelling in the back of my thigh. I was admitted to hospital immediately and had a fibrosarcoma removed. There followed six years of operations to try to save my leg but each time the sarcoma returned. Eventually in 1975 I had hindquarter surgery where my leg and part of my pelvis were removed. I was determined to return to my job as a primary school teacher and just 6 months later, wearing my prosthesis, I returned to the classroom. Despite also having a rheumatoid disease I continued the job I loved and also became a Deputy Head. I am now retired but I still wear my prosthesis every day. My experience has never stopped me doing the things I wanted to do - I've travelled as far as New Zealand, been up in a winch launch glider and flown in a ski plane that landed on a glacier. I definitely feel that I've had a happy and fulfilled life.</p>

            <h2>Ralph Sheridan, Gravesend, Kent</h2>
            <p>Having had a terrible time convincing doctors I was not well and 3 MRIs later, they eventually found a Stage 2 Chondrosarcoma sitting on my left hip. Six weeks later the RNOH Stanmore surgeons performed a hindquarter amputation and also took 50% of the Sacrum away. Fortunately that was 2½ years ago and everything seems fine. I tried and failed with a prosthesis as the Consultant said there is nothing to grip, so I would be very interested to hear form other amputees who have succeeded. Perhaps I am using it incorrectly?</p>

            <h2>Sharon Woolridge, Wolverhampton, West Midlands</h2>
            <p>In 2006 my right leg kept swelling up and having had cancer years before, the Doctor sent me to ROH Birmingham to have an MRI scan. They found a tumour on my thigh bone which turned out to be a mesenchymal chondrosarcoma. I had chemotherapy, but ended up having to have a complete amputation of my right leg.</p>
            <p>I tried a prosthetic leg, but back then they were big and bulky and very uncomfortable so I decided to use crutches instead which I do to this day.</p>
            <p>it was then that I went back to College and did a massage therapy course and passed with flying colours.</p>
            <p>I still just use crutches, and there's not much that I can't do. I enjoy spending time with my partner, my children and my grandchildren and going out with my friends. I love reading and going to concerts and have recently got into gardening.</p>
