            <p>Martin Austin MBE, Derby, Derbyshire</p>

            <p><em>Martin has not only been honoured with an MBE for his work with Nimbus Disability but his Social Enterprise has just been awarded the Queenâ€™s Award for Industry which is the highest possible accolade in the UK.</em></p>

            <p>As a child, I was always incredibly active and adept at sport; basketball and rugby both being a big part of my school and social life. Aged 14 I started to develop an intermittent limp and had to watch from the sidelines as I was forced off of the field of play. The assumption being that I had bumped or knocked something or was experiencing growing pains alongside a growth spurt. As time went by and the limp didn't improve, I was told that I had a trapped nerve, then a mild case of Spina Bifida, and prescribed anti-inflammatories. After about 6 months, I developed a cold and at the same time noticed a large swelling start to protrude from my right hip.</p>

            <p>Thanks to a great GP I was put straight into hospital for a barrage of tests and finally, on New Years Eve, was told that I had cancer.I had developed a melon-sized Osteosarcoma within my hip that led to immediate hospitalisation and 3 intensive bouts of chemotherapy. At the 3 month mark the medical professionals took stock and decided that the only course of action was a drastic amputation to remove the tumour. This led to a complete Hindquarter amputation taking with it my coccyx and part of my sacrum bone.</p>

            <p>Fast forward 30 years and I'm living a full and happy life, working full time running a Social Enterprise that supports disabled people and playing and coaching wheelchair basketball in my spare time.</p>
