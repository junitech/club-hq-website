            <p>Martin Austin MBE, Director and Founder of Nimbus Disability consultancy and captain of the Derby Wheelchair Blazers basketball team.</p>

            <p>Over the course of the last few decades the availability and choice available for disabled people who require a wheelchair as a mobility aid has come on dramatically and breathed independence into people that previously would have never been able to self mobilise.</p>

            <h2>Power Chairs</h2>

            <p>For those that would struggle to self mobilise using a manual wheelchair a power chair may be a good choice. These are large chairs designed for people that may have difficulty transferring and are controlled with a joystick.</p>

            <h2>Manual wheelchairs (attendant operated)</h2>

            <p>The cheapest option is standard self propelling chair with handles for extra support - these can typically be available from the NHS at no cost through your local wheelchair services.</p>

            <h2>Active User Chairs</h2>

            <p>For people that are regular chair users and can self mobilise there is a wide range of fashionable, light and comfortable wheelchairs from companies like RGK.</p>

            <p>These aren't cheap, but you may be able to access a wheelchair voucher scheme from your local wheelchair services to part fund the cost.</p>
