            <p>Over the course of the last few decades the availability and choice available for disabled people who require a wheelchair as a mobility aid has come on dramatically and breathed independence into people that previously would have never been able to self mobilise.</p>

            <h2>Power Chairs</h2>

            <p>These arenâ€™t cheap, but you may be able to access a wheelchair voucher scheme from your local wheelchair services to part fund the cost.</p>
