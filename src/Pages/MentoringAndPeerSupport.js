            <h1>Mentoring and peer support</h1>

            <p>There is a wide range of excellent support for HQAs as well as their partners, extended family and friends.</p>

            <p>Club HQ members provide informal mentoring and peer support to any hindquarter amputee who joins the group. When something as dramatic as amputation takes place in your life, the shared experience is very helpful and many useful hours can be spent discussing how one problem or another is overcome.  Everybody has their individual way of cooking, carrying a cup of tea, going upstairs and downstairs with crutches or tailoring their jeans or swimsuit. Interaction amongst the group is greatly valued and experiences are often shared on the Facebook Group.</p>

            <p>To request peer support please use the <a href="contact-us">contact us</a> form.</p>
