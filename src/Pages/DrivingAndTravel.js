            <h2>Driving</h2>

            <h3>Driving with a medical condition, Blue Badges, public transport and using airports as a hind quarter amputee</h3>
            <p>This link is the best place to start. Details of what's covered are in the following paragraphs. https://www.gov.uk/browse/driving/disability-health-condition</p>

            <h3>Driving with a medical condition</h3>
            <p>You must tell DVLA if you hold a driving licence and have had a limb amputated. You can be fined if you don't tell DVLA about a medical condition that affects your driving. To report your medical condition, fill in form DVLA form G1 (see below).</p>
            <p>https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/g1-online-confidential-medical-information</p>
            <p>You will usually get a decision within six weeks. DVLA might ask you to take a driving assessment.</p>

            <img src="/images/dvla-form-g1.jpg" class="center-image" alt="DVLA form G1" />

            <p>Licence holders wishing to drive after surgery should establish with their own doctor when it would be safe to do so. Drivers must ensure they remain covered by insurance to drive after surgery. You must surrender your licence to DVLA if your doctor tells you that you need to stop driving for three months or more because of your medical condition.</p>

            <h3>Disabled Driving Centres</h3>

            <p>There are 20 main disabled driving centres throughout the UK: each centre has satellite driving centres which may be more conveniently located. Special conditions apply if you live in Scotland or Wales.</p>

            <p>https://www.drivingmobility.org.uk/find-a-centre/</p>

            <p>These are independent disabled driving organisations that provide a range of mobility assessment services and advice. They provide driving tuition and assessment using dual control adapted vehicles, including vehicles fitted with hand controls or left foot accelerators. Many centres will accept self referrals. Prices vary form centre to centre.</p>

            <p>https://www.drivingmobility.org.uk/information/physical-disability/</p>

            <h3>Vehicle adaptations</h3>

            <p>You should be able to drive a car with automatic transmission, though if you have a left leg you would need to have a left foot accelerator fitted. This would cost around £450 including fitting from the best known supplier Jeff Gosling Hand Controls Ltd. or from a suitably experienced vehicle adaptation specialist. Alternatively, you may prefer to have the vehicle adapted with hand controls. You may also wish to have a hoist fitted to your vehicle to make a wheelchair or mobility scooter easier to load on and off.</p>

            <h3>Vehicle tax exemption</h3>

            <p>You can apply for exemption from paying vehicle tax if you get at least one of:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>higher rate mobility component of Disability Living Allowance (DLA)</li>
                <li>enhanced rate mobility component of Personal Independence Payment (PIP)</li>
                <li>War Pensioners' Mobility SupplementArmed Forces Independence Payment</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The vehicle must be registered in the disabled person's name or their nominated driver's name.</p>

            <p>It must only be used for the disabled person's personal needs. It cannot be used by the nominated driver for their own personal use.</p>

            <p>You can get a 50% reduction in vehicle tax if you get the PIP standard rate mobility component. The vehicle should be registered in the name of either the disabled person or their nominated driver.</p>

            <h3>Toll road concessions</h3>
            <p>You may not have to pay the full fare at some river crossings, bridges and tunnels if you're disabled. In most cases, you have to apply in advance to get a concession.</p>
            <p>https://www.gov.uk/toll-concessions</p>

            <h3>Motability</h3>

            <img src="/images/motability.jpg" class="center-image" alt="Motability logo" />

            <p>The Motability Scheme enables anyone in receipt of a higher rate mobility allowance (such as the Enhanced Rate of the Mobility Component of Personal Independence Payment or the Higher Rate Mobility Component of Disability Living Allowance) to use their mobility allowance to lease a car, scooter, powered wheelchair or Wheelchair Accessible Vehicle.</p>

            <p>You exchange all, or part of your mobility allowance to lease the vehicle of your choice. You choose the vehicle you want at a price that works for you , and payments are deducted from your higher rate mobility allowance every four weeks, then paid directly to Motability by the DWP.</p>

            <p>The standard lease is over three years, or five years if you are leasing a Wheelchair Accessible Vehicle and Motability take care of running costs such as insurance for up to three named drivers (this doesn't have to be you), servicing, maintenance, breakdown cover, tyre repair and replacement and windscreen repairs.</p>

            <p>https://www.motability.co.uk/about/how-the-scheme-works/</p>

            <p>If you are eligible for the Scheme, you should contact a Motability dealer and arrange an appointment with their Motability Scheme specialist.</p>

            <h3>VAT relief</h3>

            <p>You may not have to pay VAT on having a vehicle adapted to suit your condition, or on the lease of a Motability vehicle.</p>

            <h3>Mobility scooters and powered wheelchairs</h3>

            <p>You do not need a licence to drive a mobility scooter or powered wheelchair, but you may have to register it. Only certain types can be driven on the road. The law calls these types of vehicles "invalid carriages'.</p>

            <p>Mobility scooters and powered wheelchairs come in 2 categories:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>"class 2 invalid carriages' - these cannot be used on the road (except where there is not a pavement) and have a maximum speed of 4mph</li>
                <li>"class 3 invalid carriages' - these can be used on the road, and have a maximum speed of 4mph off the road, and 8mph on the road</li>
            </ul>

            <p>You do not need to register a class 2 invalid carriage. You must register class 3 invalid carriages.</p>

            <h3>The Blue Badge scheme</h3>

            <p>Blue Badges help disabled people park closer to their destination, whether as drivers or passengers. You qualify automatically for a badge if you meet at least one of certain benefit-related criteria: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/blue-badge-can-i-get-one/can-i-get-a-blue-badge</p>

            <img src="/images/blue-badge.png" class="center-image" alt="Blue badge" />

            <p>You are not, as hind quarter amputee (HQA) automatically entitled to a Blue Badge but you should encounter no difficulty in being awarded one, as you are eligible on the basis that "you cannot walk at all.' Start here: https://www.gov.uk/apply-blue-badge to confirm that you may be eligible, and apply to your local authority. Follow this link to find out how to apply and what documents you'll need to provide.</p>

            <p>Hints on completing the application form for a Blue Badge:</p>

            <em>A HQA is an 'enduring and substantial disability that means you are unable to walk at al during the course of a journey. The Blue Badge scheme local authority guidance (England) (Updated 30 August 2019), para. 4.42, states that, in assessing applicants, “Being unable to walk means that they cannot take a single step. The applicant needs to show that, because of their enduring and substantial disability, they cannot walk during the course of a journey. Walking involves always having one foot on the ground. And in para. 4.43: "If the applicant's only way of getting about is to swing through two elbow crutches, then they will be considered unable to walk (provided it is due to an enduring and substantial disability…'.</em>

            <p>A Blue badge costs up to £10 in England and £20 in Scotland. It's free in Wales. It normally runs for three years before needing renewal. Your council will determine your eligibility. If they decide that you are not eligible and you think that they did not take account of all the facts, you can ask them to reconsider your application.</p>

            <p>Blue badges allow people to benefit from certain parking concessions. These can vary between local authorities, though frequently unlimited parking is allowed in council car parks if you display a valid Blue Badge. Some local authorities require additional proof of a disability before allowing free parking - always check.</p>

            <p>In addition, people who have a blue badge are often able to automatically access other concessions. For example, Blue Badge holders are able to gain exemption from the London Congestion Charge by registering with Transport for London in advance. There are also special car benefit rule adjustments for Blue Badge holders in employment which could mean they pay less tax.</p>

            <p>There is a different way to apply in Northern Ireland:</p>
