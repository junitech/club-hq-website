            <h1>Fitness</h1>

            <p>There is not a shadow of doubt that your life as an HQA will be of a better quality if you achieve a good level of fitness after your amputation. Your time pre-op is invariably very debilitating and fitness levels are usually very depleted.</p>

            <p>Our arms and shoulders have not been used to walk on for tens of thousands of years and crutch users, wheelchair users and those using prosthetics will be greatly assisted by improved fitness.</p>

            <p>It is estimated that it takes 300% more effort to move as a uniped than a biped. The strain on your shoulders using a wheelchair or crutches is significant so it is not only beneficial but very important to do some training as soon as you feel able to after the operation because your core strength, upper body strength and leg muscles will dictate your mobility and your ability to return to an independent life.</p>

            <p>There is an arrangement called the GP Referral Scheme where you are referred by your GP to a local gym and have supervised training, normally for about 4 weeks. It varies by area but in a very short period of time, with a programme of weights and machines, your fitness will improve, overheating will stabilise and you will make significantly better progress with a prosthetic limb, crutches or wheelchair.</p>

            <p>Each person will need different training plans so you should consult either your physio or trainer to develop a plan. Crutches largely use your triceps and overall strength and balance is achieved by strengthening your core.</p>

            <p>Recumbent cycles, hand cycles, wheelchair basketball, golf, skiing, sailing and swimming all improve your core and your ability to move around confidently and safely.</p>
