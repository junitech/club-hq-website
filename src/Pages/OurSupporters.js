           <img src= "/images/nimbus-access-collage.png" class= "center-image" alt = "Access card and nimbus disability logo"></img>

            <p>Nimbus Disability is a social Enterprise set up to support businesses to meet and exceed their legal obligations toward disabled people. An outcome of our 15+ years of experience became a scheme called the <a href="https://www.accesscard.online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Access Card</a>.</p>

            <p><strong>The Access Card</strong> is a photo ID card for disabled people that communicates their access requirements (and legal rights) through a series of symbols on the card. The idea being that it is quick, easy and discreet for disabled people to ask for, and service providers to offer, critical reasonable adjustments.</p>

            <p>Visit the <a href="https://www.accesscard.online/find-a-credable-provider/map-of-providers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Access Card</a> website to check out 1,000 venues and visitor attractions across the UK and beyond that recognise the Card</p>
