            <h2>Nimbus and The Access Card</h2>

            <img src="/images/nimbus-disability-logo.jpg" alt="Nimbus Disability logo"></img>
            <p>Nimbus Disability is a social Enterprise set up to support businesses to meet and exceed their legal obligations toward disabled people. An outcome of our 15+ years of experience became a scheme called The Access Card.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The Access Card</strong> is a photo ID card for disabled people that communicates their access requirements (and legal rights) through a series of symbols on the card. The idea being that it is quick, easy and discreet for disabled people to ask for, and service providers to offer, critical reasonable adjustments.</p>
