            <p>Sam Coleman Kettering Northamptonshire</p>

            <p>My story begins in June, 2003, when I was walking with my husband and almost 2 year old son. I climbed up on a stile and my left femur just snapped beneath me. As we were in the water meadows near Cambridge, an ambulance couldn't find us, and then wouldn't bolt crop a chain lock to get to me. Instead they had to sedate me heavily to enable me to be lifted over a five bar gate! I was taken to the local hospital who questioned me over and over again about how I had broken my leg. They kept saying "You can't have broken your leg simply walking".  They implied that either my husband had broken it or I'd been in a car accident! Things went from bad to worse when the following day, after several scans and X-rays, I was taken down for an operation to bolt my femur back together.  They took a biopsy at the same time and 2 weeks later I was told I'd been referred to the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital in Birmingham, and that I had a Chondrosarcoma. </p>

            <p>In August that year I was given a femural replacement and was only the 20th person to have that operation. I had at least 80 staples from the hip to under the knee to join the skin together and had to learn to walk  again.</p>

            <p>All went well and I had a second son in 2005, but unfortunately a couple of months later the ROH found a lump in my leg where the bone originally was mended. It was Chondrosarcoma again. I had the lump removed.</p>

            <p>In 2007 I had my third son, but the same thing happened and I had a recurrence about 2 months after the birth. This time the cancer was much more aggressive and had appeared in the groin too. There was nothing for it but to go for a radical amputation, that we now know as a hindquarter amputation! So I found myself on one leg with three children - a 6 year old son, a 2 year old son, and a five month old son! It wasn't easy I can tell you!!</p>

            <p>After a few family setbacks, on my 3 monthly follow-up chest X-ray, it was discovered that I had metasteses in one of my lungs, one set of which was changing. I was referred to a fabulous surgeon at Birmingham Heartlands hospital who removed them with keyhole surgery. It was very painful to begin with but after a few days I felt fine! Then sadly in 2013 I had metastases in the other lung. The same surgeon removed them again and thankfully (touch wood) I have been ok since !!</p>

            <p>Life isn't easy, it's often frustrating, but I am alive! I have been lucky enough to see my beautiful boys growing up. The youngest is 13 now and I'm thankful for every second I've spent with them - even when they've been naughty!!  At least I have three excellent working limbs and I can drive, I have a nice car, and I am still independent. In 2016 I began working as a reception volunteer at my local hospice and I have found it makes me feel that I'm doing something very worthwhile. Helping and dealing with the families of patients has stopped me feeling a bit sorry for myself, which is a good thing!</p>

            <p>Getting to know the surgeons and nurses at the various hospitals that I've been treated at has resulted in them asking me to "mentor" fellow amputees and people about to undergo a hindquarter amputation. The first lady I helped was in the hospital at the same time as I had my amputation and was having hers a couple of days after me.</p>

            <p>I consider myself very lucky to still be alive and I'm so grateful to my surgeons for what they have done for me.</p>

            <p>You will get through this difficult time, although I'm sure you don't feel like you will at the moment! I can honestly say, with a positive attitude and being grateful for what you CAN do instead of what you can't, you will love life again even if it takes a little time. Life does go on after amputation and I have many friends who can prove it!</p>
