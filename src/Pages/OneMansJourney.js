            <h1>One man's journey</h1>

            <p>I was asked to write about my experience because however much the doctors and nurses may tell you, they have never experienced a hindquarter amputation and there are lots of things that happen that don't appear in the handbooks.</p>

            <p>To cut a long story short, I was experiencing hip pain and had gone into hospital for a hip replacement. The operation didn't go well and five days later I received the surprising news that I was to have my left leg, hip and pelvis removed on account of a Chondrosarcoma.</p>

            <p>My journey since that fateful day has been full of tears of frustration and disappointment but also full of tears of laughter from the ridiculous situations in which you find yourself.</p>

            <p>I lost my trousers walking down the High Street because I was very thin and you only have one hip to hold them up. It's tricky to pull up your trousers in the middle of a crowded pavement when you are new to crutches! It happened again in the chemist!</p>

            <p>I was undergoing stairs training with two physiotherapists and all three of us ended up upside down, hanging desperately on to the handrail and laughing so much it was a while before we righted ourselves.</p>

            <p>There have been lots of highs - and lots of lows but my most important advice to prospective amputees is that you have to stay upbeat and positive even when you don't feel that way.</p>

            <p>I hope that you will find these rambling notes useful. I was lucky enough to have had a mentor (who had had the same operation 6 months before me) and we used to talk on the phone for hours about all manner of things.</p>

            <p>This leads me to my first point. The fact that you are reading this means that you probably are, or have been, a patient in one of the best hospitals in the world for hind quarter amputations. ROH Birmingham and RNOH Stanmore.</p>

            <p>In the beginning you have probably had  MRI scans, PET-CT scans, Ultrasound scans and X-Rays. The reason for all this is that they have to know the exact position of the tumour as radical surgery is necessary to remove the tumour with a small margin all round to avoid any tumour spores regaining a hold.</p>

            <p>You will probably be admitted 2 days before surgery for various tests and don't worry if people are not paying you a lot of attention because that will come later - in spades! The surgeon and the anaesthetist will come to see you and explain exactly what is going to happen and then in no time you will find yourself at the door
                of the theatre signing a disclaimer that I recall told me that I could die during the operation. That was the least of my worries as Roy Castle once famously said, "I don't think that anyone who's died has ever come back and complained!".</p>

            <p>My operation took 6.5 hours and they inserted an epidural once I was anaesthetised so that I had a much lighter anaesthetic - which means that you feel much better when you come round.</p>

            <p>Shortly after I came round I was taken up to the High Dependency Unit where I stayed for 3 days. At this point you have an epidural tube in your back, morphine drips and more tubes and drips in your neck and arm than you could imagine. You will also have been catheterised as they keep your lower body numb for several days and you aren't able to pass water. You will probably be constipated but don't worry about that.</p>

            <p>I can honestly say that I can remember no pain at all during my time in the HDU. You have one nurse looking after two people so your every wish is catered for and you are fed, watered and washed and you can lie back and relax and recover. I found that I slept most of the time and three days passed in a flash before I was taken up to the ward. That was a frightening moment. Would they look after me as well?  Could I get help quickly? Actually there were no worries on that score.</p>

            <p>I suggest you keep a diary because you will find it quite cathartic to look back and realise how far you have progressed without realising it. You will go forward in leaps and bounds and in 12 months you will look back in wonderment that impossible tasks have become everyday regular tasks. I found that the drugs also affected my memory and I had some visitors that I cannot now recall seeing in the hospital.</p>

            <p>My first advice to any patient is to be pleasant to, and have a laugh with the nurses, the catering staff and the cleaners. They do one hell of a job and a “Hi!” with a smile and “please” and “thank you” make you that much easier to deal with and makes their job more pleasant. Engage them in conversation and they will almost certainly enjoy it as we do ask them to do awful jobs and they do have some terrible messes to clear up!  There will be times when you need them urgently and its no fun for them if you are Mr or Ms Grumpy!</p>

            <p>Once you are on the ward you will naturally be apprehensive as the 24 hour care is not so close by as in the HDU though of course it is still there at the end of a call button. Remember that these nurses have seen it all before and if they are not treating something as urgently as you think it should be treated, they are probably right.</p>

            <p>My experience was that I was given a cocktail of pills three or four times a day and your pain management is taken very seriously. I had the weirdest sensation that my missing leg was tied to the bed with a wire that was cutting in. Thankfully that only lasted a matter of weeks. There is a dedicated pain management team but I don't recall having any pain of consequence in hospital except for the “phantom leg”. I will come to that a little later. You will find that you are incredibly tired and sleep a great deal which is a natural response of the body. I found that I couldn't concentrate at all on reading and I hardly ever watched television.</p>

            <p>Somewhere between day 3 and day 7 after your operation two physiotherapists will come and get you to stand up using a walking frame.  I stood up, fainted and lay down again. I dreaded the return of the physios but the next day I stood up and did two hops. The third day I stood up and did ten hops! Thereafter we went in leaps and bounds (not literally!) and moved on to crutches. Initially it was ten yards but by the time I left hospital it was fifty or sixty yards. I moved onto stairs both up and down and I have to say down was the hardest. It was like standing at the top of a steep ski run and knowing you were going to fluff the first turn.</p>

            <p>Then we have the wound. We all know that when you cut your finger it heals up within the week. I know some HQAs who were out and healed in a fortnight. This is the exception as opposed to the norm. The wound will be dressed daily in the early stages and it is quite normal to wake up and find yourself in a pool of liquid that has come out of the wound. Much of the scar can heal very quickly but when they say it can take a month, believe them. My entire wound healed after four weeks but three locations about one inch long took nearly three months to heal. I have to admit that I did not cast so much as a glance at my amputation for six weeks. I felt that it was not part of me, and it rather disgusted me, but that attitude passes and I now have no issues with looking at and touching the amputation area.</p>

            <p>Plenty of sleep and a good diet are key to recovery and you must eat regularly and well if you want a speedy recovery. On that front, my only complaint was about the food on the ward and although breakfast was fine, it is not a bad idea to get your family to bring in the food that you like and are used to. It may have improved by now!</p>

            <p>The next bit of advice is make a big effort. I found that it was important to make the effort every day to wash yourself and have a shower and clean your teeth. The nurses help you to do this and will also help you go to the loo. They will take you in, and as was necessary in my case, will even wipe you bottom for you and get you back into bed. By making the effort you will progress rapidly toward recovery. You will have setbacks but don't let them get to you. Have a quick cry and get on with it.</p>

            <p>You will be amazed at how quickly you recover and before you leave hospital you will be showering yourself, going to the toilet on your own and walking around the ward on crutches.</p>

            <p>You may be taken home by ambulance on a stretcher and carried into your house and that is the start of the next stage in your recovery.</p>

            <p>This is where the physios come in. Physios come in two guises. OT or Occupational Therapists who are concerned with how you will cope at home and Physiotherapists who are interested in making you mobile and restoring your muscle strength. Eight months on and I go up and down anything, walk half a mile to Stamford Bridge to get to my seat in the football stadium and shuffle sideways along the row to my seat like a dressage horse.I go on trains and buses and aeroplanes. The only thing I took a while to pluck up the courage to do was the underground escalator because you come off at speed and I normally travel alone.</p>

            <p>My point of saying this is that you will become incredibly good on crutches. Be warned that your hands take a terrible bashing. Standard issue crutches can damage the nerves in the hands of long term users so I moved onto “permanent user fixed length crutches with comfy handles”(That's what they are called) and my hands have recovered from the numb fingers that I had experienced. Take care of your hands. They may become very calloused and require maintenance.  You should use a hand cream that is not in any way greasy. Eating crisps is the worst for getting grease on your handles.</p>

            <p>There are a plethora of different crutches but after 5 years on NHS crutches and breaking about 3 pairs a year, I have spent the money and bought a pair of Sidestix from Canada. They come with Typhoon ferrules that I have changed for Flexyfoot ferrules and they have suspension which is a boon for the shoulders. Your shoulders are your weak point as we gave up walking on our arms quite a while ago! I also have wet suit material for handle covers and padded cuffs and, as a result, most of my forearm bumps and hand callouses have now gone.</p>

            <p>Something to be aware of is that you may get incredibly tired. Your body has suffered a massive trauma and it may take you up to a year to recover properly. The other day I drove up to London, did my Christmas shopping, had a meeting and came back and was completely knackered because I am not yet fully fit, which I will talk about later.</p>

            <p>Let's go back to the OT. He or she is interested in making your transition from hospital to home as easy as possible. As you only have half a bottom, you have certain problems to address. One is trying not to fall into the loo!</p>

            <p>What you will require when you go home is an upstairs and downstairs commode as it will initially be impossible to sit down onto a normal loo seat. You will also need a wheelchair to cover distances. The OT will arrange to have this delivered and my advice is to use it as little as possible. It is really easy to succumb to using the wheelchair but I put it away in a cupboard after three weeks at home and it has never come out since apart from being lent to friends! Personally I feel it classifies me as an invalid and I am doing everything possible to return to a normal life. Those are the essentials that you need and you will then be taken over by the local OT. I would recommend that you ask for a spare pair of crutches (if one breaks you are scuppered), a shower chair, a chair air cushion(made by Repose) and a bed air mattress. They will also give you a special cushion made up of lots of tiny airbags. It may work for you, it didn't for me. The biggest problem that I had was my bottom bone which was permanently inflamed, making sitting very uncomfortable.</p>

            <p>So now we are home with masses of pills to be taken through the day, a pair of crutches and a wheelchair, possibly still a catheter, a wound that hasn't healed and to a home that wasn't designed for wheelchairs and crutches. And probably with a load of apprehension as well.</p>

            <p>I am going to make a suggestion that worked for me fantastically but may not be possible for you. My personal feeling is that I went into hospital with a wife and I didn't want to come out with a carer. If you can possibly get a carer for your first period at home it will take an enormous pressure off your spouse, who has probably been traumatised by the illness and exhausted looking after the children on her own and coming 40 miles to see you every day. It will give you enormous confidence, a confidant who understands what you are going through and means that your marriage remains as was until you are able to cope yourself. This may not be important to you but for me and my family it worked well. My wife has never been my carer and now that I am mobile she never will be. In fact I sometimes resent how much she makes me do but let me assure you that that is for the best! It would be easy to lie in bed all day and go around in a wheelchair. If you do that you will be letting life pass you by.</p>

            <p>I have already said that diet is enormously helpful to recovery and I would mention that eating a lot of beetroot is very good for cleansing the blood and you need lots of protein for healing.  You should eat three proper meals - no junk food - a day and sleep as much as you need. Don't push yourself at this early stage as it will set you back. Drink plenty of water and I would recommend that you stay off alcohol. It doesn't do you any good and can badly affect your balance! I didn't have a drink for eight months and now I have a glass of cider if we're watching a football match on telly or some such very important event!</p>

            <p>Now that you are home you will find that the hospital has arranged for the District Nurse to come every day to change your dressings and a physio will come probably twice a week to improve your condition. In my case I could not lift my good leg off the bed and nor could I sit up. I was pretty fit when I went in but a month in bed will destroy your physical condition. You lose something extraordinary like 3lbs of skeletal muscle in the first ten days. I think it slows after that or there wouldn't be much left of you!</p>

            <p>The harder you work on your exercises, the faster you will recover. I cannot stress how vitally important it is to your recovery to become as fit as possible. Furthermore, be careful about your weight. Once you feel you are at a trim fighting weight, be careful to maintain it. Overweight will wreak havoc with your shoulders in time and might even relegate you to the wheelchair.</p>

            <p>The District Nurses are great and once again make sure that you are the patient that they enjoy visiting because of the warm welcome and the smiles. They were always pressed for time and I never got them to have a cup of tea or coffee. Their job is very arduous and it is difficult to understand why they work so incredibly hard. Most will never have seen a hind-quarter amputation so you may become a novelty and every district nurse in the area will take their turn to visit you. I had 12 different nurses visit!</p>

            <p>I managed to get a home visit from my doctor just so that we made contact and thereafter he has been very helpful indeed.</p>

            <p>Perhaps it's worth mentioning visitors. I asked them not to come to the hospital because you aren't a pretty sight and I found them incredibly tiring (they came anyway!) When I got home friends wanted to come and see me. A lovely idea but it completely knackered me and in the end I said no more than one a day for 30 mins so they didn't coincide with physios, district nurses, OTs etc. Your personal maintenance will take over your life at this point.</p>

            <p>About three months after the operation you should find yourself able to do the stairs, take a shower, dress yourself, make a cup of tea, walk around and maybe even drive a bit. You will probably tire quite quickly and a rest every afternoon is a good plan.</p>

            <p>After two months at home you will probably go for a meeting with the prosthetics department. Go for a hospital with a big department if you can as they have more kit. It's your choice where you go and make sure to stick up for yourself.  I was inspected and photographed and asked whether I wanted a leg. I was a bit ambivalent about it to start with as I had heard how difficult they were and that only 10% of people use them. I had had a setback with my bottom when a muscle moved so I wasn't ready to try. At six months I went back and discussed the options and decided to go ahead. The leg was made and I went for a trial. It was much, much better than everyone had implied it would be and after one casting session and two fitting sessions we were ready to go - or at least have a try.</p>

            <p>As you can expect, Day 1 was not easy and I built up quite a sweat in about 15 minutes. I wasn't ecstatic about it and it was difficult starting in the bars but after four sessions I left the bars and went on crutches. I then went onto two sticks and after a short while started to walk with one stick. I went back to two sticks for stability and learnt to go up stairs, down stairs, up slopes and down slopes. So there we were at Christmas and the leg is home and I will wear it on Christmas Day and when we are away on holiday. I am no expert but practice makes perfect and I have had my first fall. I failed to lock the knee and went down like a sack of potatoes. Hurt pride but luckily no damage.</p>

            <p>I hope to soon wear it every day and possibly walk without a stick in time. (This never happened by the way, I found it quicker and easier on crutches).</p>

            <p>Several of the women members of Club HQ who had their amputation in their youth have worn a prosthetic every day of their lives and also had children. Body dysmorphia is definitely worse for women and so a prosthetic is a great help.</p>

            <p>That's my basic story and I will now cover a number of, what I think are, important points.</p>

            <h2>Crutches</h2>
            <p>You will be given crutches by the hospital. Make sure that OT give you a spare pair because you are stuffed if one gets broken, bent or you leave them behind.  When you come to training for the leg, get the hospital to give you fixed length crutches. They are heavier, stronger and don't squeak. If you are quite heavy you will run through ferrules every four weeks. What happens is that contrary to what you might think, 70% of your weight goes on the good leg crutch side and 30% on the amputated leg side. To preserve your ferrules, turn them 180 degrees every week and change sides every two weeks to get even wear. The standard handles may damage the nerve in your hand and cause numbness in the fingers. If you can get on with them, use comfy handles. You may also experience trigger finger overnight where the finger tendons inflame and your fingers lock in the clenched fist position. One hand has now recovered and the other is improving. I found putting the hand in an ice bucket before going to bed was beneficial. The physio will show you how to massage the tendons.</p>
            <p>I now use www.flexyfoot.com ferrules which are less slippery and always have 100% contact with the ground. They are, I think, the best but you have to take an inch off your crutches.</p>
            <p>By pure chance I bought a new pair of crutches that were 1” shorter than I had previously used. Remarkably, my shoulder pains and elbow pains stopped within 7 days. Crutch length is very important.</p>
            <p>People who are light like <a href="http://www.cool-crutches.co.uk">Cool Crutches</a> which are themselves light and have cushioned handles. For sports people and heavy users I would recommend <a href="https://www.sidestix.com/">Sidestix</a>.</p>

            <h2>Prosthetics</h2>
            <p>Don't rush. Your stump needs to be very well healed before you even consider a leg.</p>
            <p>The new silicon sockets are much more comfortable and don't even consider going private. Your leg with a computerised knee and special hip is probably £20,000 to £40,000 and maintenance is horrendous.  If you get a leg, make sure you use it all the time. That way you get upgraded to the best versions.</p>

            <h2>Pills</h2>
            <p>You will probably find that you are taking a huge amount of pills when you return home. It is a major operation to work out what you take when and know when supplies are low. I bought a 7 day pill dispenser from the £1 shop for 99p and it was better than any of the chemists' ones which were £15 or so. On Sunday night I would put the pills in the little dispensers separated into four times per day and seven days per week. I would then leave the pills on the kitchen table and take them with meals and before bed. After dispensing for a week you can see what is low and ask for a repeat prescription on Monday morning.</p>
            <p>I managed to get off all my pills at 7 months and just use an anti-inflammatory, and a painkiller as required. Usually this is when I have to sit for a long time in meetings or travelling which means you don't move around on your chair all the time.</p>

            <h2>Cushions</h2>
            <p>I had tremendous trouble with my remaining backside as the sitting bone seemed to get very inflamed. This results from a combination of sitting on it and inflammation from the adductor muscles and hamstring. Some people are OK and some suffer a lot. It took nearly five months for mine to subside and I found out what the problem was. My foot was working overtime to keep me balanced and the adductor muscles and hamstrings were suffering terribly. I realised that a trainer was better than a shoe. This led me to an Orthotics specialist which I deal with later. In the meantime I tried every possible cushion and it is remarkable how uncomfortable most people's sofas are! In the end I persuaded the OT to get me a cushion made to fit my new bottom. They take an impression with a thing like a beanbag from which they draw the air and then make a plaster cast. From that they make a foam cushion that is just wonderful to sit on as it keeps you upright. This can be used in a chair, on a train or plane and I sewed a laptop strap onto it and carry it on my back everywhere I go. It is especially good for keeping you upright in a car. You will find that OTs are very helpful but are constrained by budget. If however you cannot sit in a chair without holding yourself up on the arms, they will do something about it.</p>

            <h2>Toilet seat</h2>
            <p>The first time I sat on the toilet seat I had lost so much weight that I fell through it and I had to hold myself up for eight months. Now OT are making me a moulded seat so that I can sit normally (and hopefully be able to read the paper!). They are virtually obliged to make it possible to sit on a loo and the delay is partly my fault. I learnt early on that making fundamental decisions is not to be recommended when everything is changing all the time. I originally asked for a standard but moulded seat and I realised that that would be a disaster as I couldn't get down there with nothing to hold onto. Now the moulded seat is going to be on a collapsible commode so that I can take it with me when necessary.</p>

            <h2>Bathrooms</h2>
            <p>You will work this out for yourself but OT may depending on their budget, provide shower bars, shower chairs and possibly bath lifts. You have to be able to shower or bathe and you should find they are very helpful.</p>

            <h2>VAT free</h2>
            <p>Any disabled aid like crutches and wheelchairs is normally VAT free.  Mobility sites will point this out and you fill out a short declaration so that you pay no VAT.</p>

            <h2>Falls</h2>
            <p>I am afraid that it is a fact of life that you will have falls and I do hope you don't hurt yourself. If you stretch regularly you will better avoid injury but you can't avoid the bruises. I find the worst part is the embarrassment. I can remember every fall. One of the best ones was coming out of a car park and putting my crutch down a drain and falling slowly to the pavement in the rain. I was going to meet someone for a coffee and it is hard to look cool going into a cafe with your jacket and trousers dripping wet and so conspicuous on crutches!.</p>
            <p>Another time I was walking past the supermarket checkouts, my crutch ferrules had snow in the tread and I went completely for six. The worst thing was ten people rushing to help and the scene it created. I hop-crawled six feet on one knee and pulled myself up on the counter trying to look unruffled as if this happened every day!</p>
            <p>It's the wet that's the most difficult and one time I was walking in the dark and next thing I was on my backside. There was some moss on the brick paving and the crutches went despite my trying to be really careful.</p>
            <p>Then there was a fall on my third day home when my left arm in the crutch crumbled under my weight and I caught the range handle on the way down. The trouble was that two women couldn't lift me up so my wife had to run for the neighbours. My leg was twisted so it was like the cartoon of the man hanging on the guttering, because if I let go it was really going to hurt. There have been other stumbles but you have to keep a sense of humour.</p>
            <p>Trying to get up and pretend it doesn't matter is like in the films when the drunk is trying to pretend he's sober!</p>

            <h2>Stairs</h2>
            <p>Walking up and down stairs is easy after a while and you only need the handrail for security. Some people find it very hard and you can rent a stairlift. I slept downstairs for two weeks and then dealt with the stairs. My friend had a Stannah lift put in but with my hatred of all things disabled I refused to go down that route. I now go up without holding onto the handrail and come down two steps at a time. As with everything on this journey back to normality, practice makes perfect.</p>

            <h2>Fitness</h2>
            <p>Your physical fitness is quite simply going to dictate the speed of your recovery and ability to handle the amputation. If you have always been a couch potato then now you must change. Fitness is everything and your upper body strength and leg muscles will dictate your limitations.</p>
            <p>There is a marvellous arrangement called the GP Referral Scheme where you are referred by your GP to a local gym and have supervised training. I did it four times a week for six weeks prior to getting my leg with a programme of weights and running on the crosstrainer. My fitness level rocketed, my overheating stabilised a bit and I made very fast progress on the leg. At the beginning they said that walking with crutches was the best I could hope for. Because I am fit they now realise I might walk without even a stick.</p>
            <p>Now my leg training is pretty much over, I am going back to the gym and I won't come out until I am fit enough to cycle 60 miles in 10 hours which is my target for six months time. I have borrowed a recumbent tricycle (you sit down on it with your bum 6 inches from the road) and clip your foot into the pedal. The first day I did about 200 metres and was spent. Six weeks later I could do uphill and have done 10.5 miles. The bonus is that my leg is getting much stronger and I find that my balance on one leg is much better. I can now stand without crutches and take off my jacket.  An impossible dream six months ago.</p>
            <p>I have a series of exercises designed by a physio for amputees and they are hard but very effective. One of the best is standing on an air cushion and balancing on one leg. You balance four times for ten seconds and repeat four times. The effect on your balance is immediate - and astonishing because balance is all about your core.</p>

            <h2>Overheating</h2>
            <p>If you have an HQA you lose about 24% of your surface area. That is one quarter of your cooling capacity that has been removed so you might find that you run hot most of the time and moving around makes you sweat like a pig. Don't worry, it is normal and in my experience improves with time.</p>

            <h2>Moods</h2>
            <p>I never suffered from mood swings pre-amputation. I decided to stop all my medication Pregabalin, Tramadol etc. and after a month or so became very melancholy for a few days. Take care as painkillers have a similar effect to happy pills and what I did by coming off them too quickly was not clever. Discuss medication changes with your doctor or you can surprise yourself. I have now taken no daily medication for pain for three years. I keep a few Tramadol and Ibuprofen for serious phantom pain attacks because I don't think those can stop. Plenty of water and a mobile life definitely helps.</p>

            <h2>Phantom pain</h2>
            <p>We all suffer phantom pain and only the most fortunate avoid it.</p>
            <p>I was definitely helped by having mirror therapy as I learnt to move my phantom leg without it cramping.</p>
            <p>The Brain that Changes Itself by Norman Doige gives you an excellent understanding of phantom pain which in my case is short sharp electric shocks either in my missing knee or ankle. Just like touching an electric sheep fence and not letting go!</p>
            <p>There is also a sensitivity which is on the amputation and which I describe as getting “very active or fizzing” - mini shocks and intermittent pain across the area.</p>
            <p>Everybody has their own way of coping and I have tried a number of methods. I personally found that Pregabalin, Gabapentin, Amitriptyline and the like made no difference after a month or so.</p>
            <p>I tried ComfortMax from LifeExtension and it reduced the pain but I spent a lot of time asleep.</p>
            <p>Turmeric taken every day is a natural anti-inflammatory. Not bad.</p>
            <p>I find that if I act as soon as I get a murmur of phantom pain, a 400mg Ibuprofen works within 30 minutes. If it is still bubbling I take another. If it is just not dissipating, I then take a Tramadol which works within the hour. We all have our own methods and only experimenting will help you. Three months after I came out of hospital, I had to go to a wedding. Two Ibuprofen and two Tramadol before I went and I felt nothing!</p>

            <h2>Cooking</h2>
            <p>This has been my nemesis. I find that standing without crutches for a long time is very hard on the lower back and food preparation is time consuming. My best advice is get a perch stool and have someone to help move heavy hot pans for you as they can be very dangerous. I can cook and do cook - but very little! Many women amputees still do all the family cooking.</p>

            <h2>Shopping</h2>
            <p>This can be a problem on account of having to carry things. Most shops are very helpful and will put a carrier bag in your car for you.</p>
            <p>I have experience of several supermarkets.</p>
            <p>Sainsburys provide a complimentary electric scooter with shopping basket that you can drive around the store yourself. This service is also often available in shopping malls and I have experienced this in Westfield, London.</p>
            <p>Lidl and Aldi seem to have no facilities for assistance but the local Morrisons does have an electric scooter available to borrow.</p>
            <p>Waitrose will provide somebody to push your trolley, load it all in, go through the checkout and put it in your car!</p>
            <p>After five years I decided to splash out on an expensive scooter and I have the lightest scooter on the market which I bought in Germany, <a href="https://www.travelscoot.com/order-now.html">https://www.travelscoot.com/order-now.html</a>. It is great for pavements and shops but no good at all once you leave an even hard surface. It is very light to lift in and out of the car and I now use it for all my shopping when it is raining but just supermarkets when it is dry.</p>

            <h2>Reviews</h2>
            <p>You will probably have quarterly reviews and they are always a bit scary if you have had cancer. I find putting my head in the sand is the easiest approach but it doesn't make it much easier. I would recommend taking your partner to reviews to make it easier but personally I didn't want my wife to suffer those dreaded hours of waiting in outpatients so I went alone.</p>

            <h2>Shoulder bag or backpack?</h2>
            <p>Carrying is tricky though I have improved by using the hand to multitask on the crutches! I have found that a shoulder bag is easiest and best though others prefer a backpack which I can't get off without sitting down. The flexibility of your shoulders is the limiting factor and decides which way you go.</p>

            <h2>Leg training</h2>
            <p>When you first try on your leg, you probably wonder why you bothered. It is so hard to walk and seems almost impossible. Within a couple of sessions you will find that you are out of the parallel bars and going for your life. No chance of a Clint Eastwood swagger. More like a Douglas Bader roll! I found it hard to start with and had a bad fall which rattled my cage. I hadn't locked the knee properly before putting my weight on the leg. It was in the hospital gym and I went down like a sack of potatoes knocking things all over the place. Nothing much hurt apart from my pride, but I haven't failed to lock the knee since! I then had a bad day in the gym and the very next day it just all clicked and I started to walk better and went with one stick. One minute it's gloomsville and the next day you feel like you've won the Olympics. One step back then two forwards.</p>

            <h2>Foot</h2>
            <p>Nobody told me to look after my foot. You are now putting an enormous strain on one foot and an orthotist told me that in one year my foot would spread 2 inches if unprotected. I now have an orthotic that keeps my foot completely in line with my leg and direction and I wear a high boot type shoe to keep the structure of the foot from spreading. Nobody tells you about this but I believe that your remaining sitting bone benefits from the stability of your hamstring. Your physio will guide you.</p>

            <h2>Discipline</h2>
            <p>I mention this because self-discipline is hugely important to recovery. You must get up on time, eat properly and regularly, drink plenty of water, exercise, get fit, set a new challenge and don't let physio, mirror training, leg training, reviews etc. rule your life. Make them take second place and your life will be enhanced. Get out of the rut and move on. You must live as normal a life as possible and get back to work. Keep your confidence and self respect. Just about anything is possible on the sporting front with football on crutches, one-legged skiing, cycling and rowing to name a few. I personally have skied, row in the gym and go out cycling a lot on my recumbent. I have an electric assist and have a great 20 mile circuit which keeps me in trim. I still go to the gym three or four times a week as I personally find fitness and lack of phantom pain go together. Also, your balance is dependent upon your core strength.</p>

            <h2>Waterworks</h2>
            <p>Depending on your surgery, you may have waterworks problems. Don't panic. These things happen and I have found that I have changed enormously for the better over 12 months. Once again, getting fit is a great help. Everyone can do it whatever your weight and age.</p>

            <h2>Taxis</h2>
            <p>Black cabs are a doddle. The jump seat in all black cabs has a release button which swings it out over the pavement. Some cab drivers don't even know it exists! You back up to the cab, sit on the jump seat and swing it back into position and you are in. If you need to sit on your cushion, you can swing into the back seat using the grab handle. To get out reverse the procedure.</p>
            <p>Don't use the new Mercedes Van taxis, They are a nightmare to get into. Addison Lee in London have people carriers with seats at the perfect height and very accessible.</p>

            <h2>Planes</h2>
            <p>You need to register as requiring assistance on all flights. I go for the “can walk unaided in plane but requires wheelchair to aircraft door” option.</p>
            <p>As Frank Gardner put in his book: You get loaded into the catering entrance on a forklift like a hot meal! My only time that I always use a wheelchair is airports and museums. I get the wheelchair at check-in, you get pushed through security and customs and right to the departure point. If you are on the tarmac, they take you in a portacabin on a lift that they drive across the tarmac and put you level with the catering door to walk in on your crutches. Don't let the stewards take your crutches away or you can't go to the loo! At your destination it's the same in reverse.</p>
            <p>I took my leg on easyjet as hand luggage, much to the embarrassment of my son, and as it didn't fit in the locker, they gave it it's own seat! I have always been very well looked after on planes travelling economy.</p>

            <h2>Standing up</h2>
            <p>If you are tall as I am, standing up from the sitting position is a problem. Whenever your upper leg is less than a right angle with your lower leg it requires a greater effort to stand up. It is a good idea to find a chair that allows your leg to rest at a minimum of a right angle and to have a car with a high seat. I suggest getting a cushion permanently upholstered into the chair of your choice. As you can guess, getting up from the recumbent bike is very hard. Surprisingly, because it always is a surprise, getting off the bike is getting easier as my leg gets stronger. Now that I go to the gym frequently I can easily take the stairs two at a time. It's my little personal challenge.</p>

            <h2>What you can achieve</h2>
            <p>The sky really is the limit in this game. I have a high level amputee friend (hemi-pelvectomy) who is in his early fifties. He doesn't have a car. He cycles everywhere up to 80 miles in a day. He has an allotment. He works in his workshop. He has a leg. He walks on it for up to 10 hours per day. He held down a normal management job in an electronic company. He walks a mile into town to go shopping. He gets in and out of a car as if he had two legs. He puts up a tent and goes camping with a trailer on the back of his bike. He is Mr Fantastic and he is my role model.</p>

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>Challenge yourself, set new goals all the time and you can lead an almost normal life and make it much easier and happier for all those around you. Don't become a dependant. Don't be a victim or make your other half a victim. Be a contributor. It's much more fun!</p>

            <h2>Counselling</h2>
            <p>Some time after my amputation, I plunged into depression and was quite shocked to find myself in that situation. I had a wonderful NHS counsellor who got me back on the rails. Amputation is very similar to a bereavement and if you need help, swallow your pride and ask for it. Depression and anxiety is common after amputation and MacMillan (generally whilst you are in hospital) and Sarcoma UK  provide great support in that direction.</p>

            <p>If I was to pinpoint the four most important things that I have discovered, they would be:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Don't put on weight</li>
                <li>Get as fit as you have ever been - or fitter!</li>
                <li>Have a super-positive attitude and don't allow yourself to be defined by your amputation.</li>
                <li>Know that everything is possible - only your mind holds you back.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>...and good luck!</p>
