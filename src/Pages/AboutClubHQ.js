            <h1>About Club HQ</h1>

            <p>In the United Kingdom, primary bone cancer affects around 550 people per year and circa 25 of those require a hindquarter amputation to remove a pelvic sarcoma.</p>

            <p>The unusual nature of the operation has meant that sources of post-operation guidance are not necessarily immediately obvious. We are delighted to have been asked by ROH Birmingham and RNOH Stanmore to work with them to improve their HQA patient experience and this website is part of our response.</p>

            <p>Club HQ is a small self-help community whose members have all undergone the life-changing experience of a hindquarter amputation. The personal experiences and knowledge of our members in overcoming the challenges of such an amputation have been consolidated here as a resource for those who are about to have, or have had a hindquarter amputation.</p>

            <p>There are contributions from Surgeons, Specialist nurses, Prosthetists and Charities on diverse subjects ranging from phantom pain to mental health and discounted tickets to Paris on Eurostar!</p>

            <p>Our mission is to provide support through our experiences and make the journey as easy as possible for those making the transition from bipeds to unipeds.</p>

            <p>Club HQ members are pleased to mentor new amputees from their initial diagnosis through to their return home, and thereafter. If you wish to take advantage of our mentoring service please use the contact page.</p>

            <p>We welcome all contributions to our website.</p>
